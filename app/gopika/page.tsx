            The dedication and compassion shown by Maai towards both cows and
            people in need is truly remarkable. It’s clear that her legacy lives
            on through the work being carried out by the institution she founded.
            The story of Maai’s connection with the cows and her journey of
            overcoming adversity to become a mother to orphans is truly touching.

            Caring for animals, especially cows, and providing them with shelter,
            medical attention, and respect is a noble cause. It’s heartening to
            see the efforts being made to improve the lives of old, sick, stray,
            and abandoned cows.

            For anyone who shares a love for animals and believes in the
