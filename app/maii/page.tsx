              Her marriage did not last long. She fought against the exploitation of local women who collected dried cow dung. due to which her husband abandoned her at the age of 20 yrs. At that time She was pregnant. Sindhu Tai was thrown out of her husband’s house. In that period she gave birth to a baby girl. She cut her umbilical cord with the stone which was lying there. To survive she started begging and singing on the streets and rains in Amravati. With concern for her safety, she took shelter in a cremator. Once she saw a dead body burning. The last rites were over and the relatives of the departed had left. They had left some flour as a part of the last rituals for the departed soul. She took that flour, prepared a bhakari (roti), and baked it on the fire, which was still consuming the dead body. In her journey she saw hungry children begging around her. She took them under her wings. She gave them food and shelter in whatever way she could. This became mission of her life. Lovingly orphans children were call her Aai.In order to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her biological daughter and her adopted children, she intrusted her daughter to Shrimant Dagdushet Halwai Trust, Pune. She devoted her entire life to orphans. She was called “MAAI” She has been a “MOTHER” to many. She was an icon of love & Compassion. She sheltered thousands of orphans and gave them dignity in life. Her orphanage is an orphanage with a difference. Generally orphanages just keep their children up to the age of 18 MAAI keeps her children till they get their jobs or get married and settle in life. She taught the values of living and that’s why her children are living beautiful lives today

            After the sad demise of Sindhutai Sapakal in Jan 2022, Mamata Tai –
            her biological child was entrusted the responsibility of being the
            mother of Sindhutai’s 260 children. Going back to the early days,
            Sindhutai had given away her daughter “Mamata” to the Shrimant Dagdu
            Sheth Halwai trust of Pune, to eliminate the feeling of partiality
            between her own child and the adopted children.
            Years later and after completing education, Mamata-tai – as she is
            lovingly called by the children, returned to help and assist
            “Maai”. Mamata Tai and her team are determined to move ahead with
            the spirit and devotion. Carrying on Sindhutai’s legacy of
            dedication, devotion, affection, trust and love is not an easy
            task.
            During Maai’s lifetime, she has set up a banyan tree to help the
            orphans, the poor and the needy, and Mamata-tai has taken this
            responsibility to fulfil “Maai’s” vision and nourish this tree in
            best of her capacity.
